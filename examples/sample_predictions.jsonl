{"id": 1, "prompt": "Q: If a train travels 60km in 1 hour and 30 minutes, what is its average speed?\nA:\n", "pred": "<reasoning>\nStep 1: Convert 1 hour 30 minutes to hours, which is 1.5 hours.\nStep 2: Average speed is distance divided by time.\nStep 3: 60 divided by 1.5 equals 40.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>40 km/h</answer>", "ref": "40", "correct": true, "trace_score": 0.92}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "Q: A store sells pens for $2 each. How much do 7 pens cost?\nA:\n", "pred": "<reasoning>\nStep 1: Price per pen is $2.\nStep 2: Number of pens is 7.\nStep 3: Total cost = 2 × 7 = $14.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>$14</answer>", "ref": "14", "correct": true, "trace_score": 0.88}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "Q: What is the time complexity of binary search and why?\nA:\n", "pred": "<reasoning>\nBinary search repeatedly halves the search space.\nAt each step, one comparison is made and half of the remaining elements are discarded.\nThe number of steps required grows logarithmically with the input size.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>O(log n)</answer>", "ref": "O(log n)", "correct": true, "trace_score": 0.91}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "Q: There are 45 students in a class. 20 are boys. How many are girls?\nA:\n", "pred": "<reasoning>\nStep 1: Total students = 45.\nStep 2: Boys = 20.\nStep 3: Girls = 45 - 20 = 25.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>25</answer>", "ref": "25", "correct": true, "trace_score": 0.85}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "Q: Why is having a clear reasoning process important in decision making?\nA:\n", "pred": "<reasoning>\nClear reasoning helps break complex problems into smaller steps.\nIt reduces cognitive bias by making assumptions explicit.\nIt also allows others to evaluate and trust the decision process.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>Because it improves clarity, reduces errors, and builds trust in decisions.</answer>", "ref": "non-verifiable", "correct": true, "trace_score": 0.89}
